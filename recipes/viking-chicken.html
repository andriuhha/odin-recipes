    <h3>The basic idea behind Viking Chicken is that you are cooking the really nice chicken on top of a bed of fruit
        (sweet) and vegetables (savory).</h3>
    <p>The sweet and savory combo, mixed with chicken fat, butter and salt, is killer. And you don’t need to be too
        picky about what the veggies are.</p>
    <p>You can clean out the refrigerator with what you’ve got if you like. That’s why I call it “Viking,” because it’s
        sort of low brow and hard to mess up</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (3- to 4-pound) whole chicken</li>
        <li>1 small lemon or clementine</li>
        <li>Several sprigs fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>1 to 2 large yellow onions</li>
        <li>3 to 4 whole firm fruits such as apples, pears, or quince</li>
        <li>1 to 2 pounds firm or crisp vegetables such as carrots, Brussels sprouts, potatoes, sweet potatoes,
            asparagus, mushrooms, or garlic cloves</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Unsalted butter</li>
        <li>Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 450°F. Set a rack in the lower-middle of the oven.</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken from its packaging and thoroughly pat it dry. Place the lemon or clementine inside the
            cavity along with the whole rosemary sprigs, and truss the legs together.</li>
        <li>Create a bed of fruits and vegetables in a roasting pan to raise the chicken off the bottom. Chop the onions
            and a few pieces of fruit into rings, and scatter them over the bottom of the pan. If you're using asparagus
            or carrots, lay them side-by-side on top of the onions in the center of the pan. Sprinkle the vegetables and
            fruit generously with salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Set the chicken on top of the bed of fruits and vegetables. Roughly chop and scatter any remaining fruits
            and vegetables around the chicken.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the chicken and all the fruits and vegetables with olive oil and sprinkle generously with sea salt.
            Set a few pats of butter atop the chicken.</li>
        <li>Place the chicken into the oven and immediately lower the oven temperature to 400°F. Roast for 1 to 1 1/2
            hours, until the vegetables are cooked, chicken's skin is golden, and the chicken registers 165°F in the
            thigh.</li>
        <li>Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and tent with foil. Let the chicken rest for 15 minutes before
            carving. While you're waiting, toss the vegetables with the pan juices and transfer to a serving bowl. If
            desired, make a simple gravy with the leftover bits in the pan.</li>
        <li>Serve while the chicken and vegetables are warm. Leftovers will keep refrigerated for up to 4 days.</li>
    </ol>
